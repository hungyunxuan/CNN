# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for CIFAR-10 Classification

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. It includes steps for data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Loads CIFAR-10 data, reshapes labels, normalizes images.
- **Visualization**: Provides a function to visualize samples from the dataset.
- **CNN Model**: Builds a CNN model for image classification.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Trains the model on the training set and evaluates its performance on the test set.

## Installation

Ensure you have the required libraries installed:

  ```bash
  pip install tensorflow matplotlib numpy
```
